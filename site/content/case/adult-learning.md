The tech trend shows the mobile learning has taken over the e-learning market covering a spread of user motivations. In each market segmentation, we found out some anchor products and this help us to see the big picture of the market trend in the future.

In order to understand the learning environment and lifestyle evolution of our target users, we chose to conduct the research at their real life environment with profiles covering both active and lapsed users.

The methods we use include home-visits, video ethnography and user interview. One of the pain points of our users is to have too many devices and platforms without a centralized product experience.

With the tools of personas and user journey, weâ€™ve brought the unmet needs of user groups, gaps of user flow back to life, and run Ideation workshops with different teams to come up with new ideas. We successfully leveraged user insights to potential business opportunities.
