As an anthropologist and a writer, I explore the beliefs, behaviors, stories and journeys that shape us.
I have a decade of experience in <highlight>consumer research, global ethnography and narrative non-fiction
writing</highlight>.
                
I’ve work extensively in areas crossing <highlight>education, entertainment, insurance, home appliance, health
wellness and experience design</highlight>. My qualitative research skill includes <highlight>Ethnography, Digital Ethnography,
Participatory Design, Focus Group, One on one in-depth interviews and Usability Testing</highlight>.
               
Currently I’m working at Touch Innovation, a design research consultancy I co-founded in Shanghai China
in 2016. Touch aims to connect global businesses and creatives with Chinese consumers through research
expertise.
